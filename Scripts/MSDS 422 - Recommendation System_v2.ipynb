    "### Problem Background\n",
    "- In today's digital age, streaming platforms offer a vast library of movies to users. \n",
    "- However, with the sheer volume of available content, users often struggle to discover movies that match their interests. \n",
    "- A movie recommendation system aims to solve this problem by leveraging user behavior and preferences to provide personalized movie suggestions, enhancing user experience and engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "The goal of this project is to design and develop an efficient and accurate movie recommendation system that can intelligently suggest movies to users based on their past viewing history, ratings, and the behavior of similar users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "As a part of this project, we shall be building recommendations using the following algorithms,\n",
    "- Overall movie recommendation based on popularity and genre\n",
    "- Content based recommendation\n",
    "- Collaboration based movie recommendation"

    "## 1.2 Recommendation Algorithm Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall Movie recommendations**\n",
    "- This is a Simple Recommender, which offers generalized recommendations to every user based on movie popularity and genre. \n",
    "- The basic idea behind this recommender is that movies that are more popular and more critically acclaimed will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience. \n",
    "- This model does not give personalized recommendations based on the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Content Based Movie Recommendation**\n",
    "- A Content-Based Recommendation System suggests movies to users based on their intrinsic attributes such as genres, actors, and plot details. \n",
    "- It personalizes recommendations by matching item content to user preferences\n",
    "- This is achieved by building an engine that computes similarity between movies based on certain metrics and suggests movies that are most similar to a particular movie that a user liked.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Collaborative Filtering Based Movie Recommendation**\n",
    "- Collaborative Filtering is a recommendation technique that identifies user preferences by analyzing interactions and behaviors of similar users. \n",
    "- Collaborative Filtering is based on the idea that users similar to a user A,  can be used to predict how much user A will like a particular movie, based on their likings and reviews\n",
    "- This approach offers personalized suggestions and is effective for both known and unknown items"

    "**Limitations of Overall Movie Recommendation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Limited Personalization: IMDB weighted ratings focus on a general audience's perspective and don't take into account individual preferences, viewing history, or context. This can result in recommendations that may not align with a user's unique tastes and interests.\n",
    "- Genre Oversimplification: The IMDB formula applied within each genre assumes that all movies within a genre should be ranked similarly, ignoring the diversity and nuances within genres. It overlooks the fact that users might have preferences for specific sub-genres, themes, or styles.\n",
    "- New and Unrated Movies: Emerging movies with potential might be overlooked because they lack sufficient ratings or historical data. This limits the ability to recommend newer, lesser-known, or indie films.\n",
    "- Biased Popularity: The IMDB formula tends to favor popular and widely-known movies, potentially excluding hidden gems that may have smaller but dedicated fan bases.\n",
    "- Cultural and Regional Differences: The formula does not account for the fact that user preferences can vary based on cultural backgrounds, regional trends, and language preferences.\n",
    "- No Personal Context: IMDB ratings do not consider a user's watching history, past ratings, or demographic information. Recommendations based on such context can lead to more relevant and engaging suggestions."

    "The recommender we built in the previous section suffers some severe limitations. For one, it gives the same recommendation to everyone, regardless of the user's personal taste. If a person who loves romantic movies (and hates action) were to look at our Top 15 Chart, s/he wouldn't probably like most of the movies. If s/he were to go one step further and look at our charts by genre, s/he wouldn't still be getting the best recommendations.\n",

    "For instance, consider a person who loves Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, My Name is Khan and Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham. One inference we can obtain is that the person loves the actor Shahrukh Khan and the director Karan Johar. Even if s/he were to access the romance chart, s/he wouldn't find these as the top recommendations.\n",
